```

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/housing_price_analysis.git
   cd housing_price_analysis
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Full Pipeline

The main.py script provides a complete pipeline from data processing to model evaluation:

```
python main.py --data_path data/raw/housing_data.csv --models linear,ridge,rf --output_dir reports
```

Options:
- `--data_path`: Path to housing data CSV file (if file doesn't exist, synthetic data will be created)
- `--models`: Comma-separated list of models to train (options: linear, ridge, lasso, rf, gbm, arimax, var, lstm)
- `--output_dir`: Directory to save results and reports

### Using Individual Components

You can also use individual components from the library:

```python
from src.data import preprocess
from src.features import build_features
from src.models import train_model, predict_model, evaluate_model
from src.visualization import visualize

# Load and preprocess data
data = preprocess.load_data('data/raw/housing_data.csv')
data = preprocess.clean_data(data)

# Build features
data = build_features.create_price_per_sqft(data)
data = build_features.create_seasonal_features(data, date_col='date')

# Train a model
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
model = train_model.train_random_forest(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate model
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
metrics = evaluate_model.calculate_regression_metrics(y_test, y_pred)

# Create visualizations
visualize.plot_model_predictions(y_test, y_pred, model_name='Random Forest')
```

## Data

The project can work with any housing dataset that includes price information. The code is designed to handle:
- Property characteristics (size, bedrooms, etc.)
- Location information (coordinates, regions, zip codes)
- Time series data (with date columns)

If no dataset is provided, the system can generate synthetic data for testing and demonstration.

## Models

### Regression Models
- **Linear Regression**: Simple baseline model
- **Ridge Regression**: Linear model with L2 regularization
- **Lasso Regression**: Linear model with L1 regularization and feature selection
- **Random Forest**: Ensemble of decision trees
- **Gradient Boosting**: Boosted trees with gradient descent

### Time Series Models
- **ARIMAX**: Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous variables
- **VAR**: Vector Autoregression for multivariate time series

### Deep Learning
- **LSTM**: Long Short-Term Memory network for sequential data
